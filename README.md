# South Australia Crime Data Analysis (2022-2023)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes crime data for South Australia from the year 2022 to 2023. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/south-australia-crime-data-2022-2023).

## Overview

The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging the following libraries:

- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Plotly: Interactive data visualization

## Contents

- **Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.
- **2022-23_data_sa_crime.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Data Exploration

The analysis covers various aspects of the crime data, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of crime across different suburbs and offense levels.
- Visualization of crime trends over time.
- most frequent offenses and places where it registered

## Instructions

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/south-australia-crime-data-2022-2023).
2. Place the downloaded CSV file (`2022-23_data_sa_crime.csv`) in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Analysis.ipynb`) and run the cells to execute the analysis.

- I have included Insights and conclusions in notebook that are derived from visualization.
