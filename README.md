## THIS NOTEBOOK CONTAINS AN INTERACTIVE GRAPHS SO IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE NOTEBOOK BECAUSE THE INTERACTIVE GRAPH MIGHT NOT BE DIRECTLY VISIBLE IN GITHUB BUT WHEN YOU RUN IT IN A LOCAL ENVIRONMENT WITH THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES MENTIONED YOU WILL SEE THE MAGIC OF PLOTLY.
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes crime data for South Australia from the year 2022 to 2023. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/south-australia-crime-data-2022-2023).

## Overview

The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging the following libraries:

- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Plotly: Interactive data visualization

## Contents

- **Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.
- **2022-23_data_sa_crime.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Data Exploration

The analysis covers various aspects of the crime data, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of crime across different suburbs and offense levels.
- Visualization of crime trends over time.
- most frequent offenses and places where it registered

## Instructions

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/south-australia-crime-data-2022-2023).
2. Place the downloaded CSV file (`2022-23_data_sa_crime.csv`) in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Analysis.ipynb`) and run the cells to execute the analysis.

- I have included Insights and conclusions in notebook that are derived from visualization.
